# Diabetes-Classifier---Machine-Learning
# Diabetes Classifier

The DiabetesClassifier_JU is a Java program that uses machine learning to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. This project makes use of the Weka library, a popular suite of machine learning software written in Java.

## Features

- Load ARFF data file
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Build a decision tree (J48) classifier from the training data
- Classify instances in the test set
- Calculate the accuracy of the classifier

## Setup and Running

Before running the DiabetesClassifier_JU, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Weka library
- A dataset in ARFF format. In our case, we use the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. 

To run the program:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the ARFF file.
3. Run the Java program using the command `java DiabetesClassifier_JU.java`.
4. The program will output the accuracy of the classifier.
